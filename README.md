During our training at Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp, we practice our freshly learned skills on an open source data base from Kaggle:
Kaggle / olist
here is the link

This is a challenge propose by kaggle in which we are provided with housing market of Boston, based on various criteria we are given the associate prices of the houses in the dataset.

Then we are provided with a test dataset for which we need to proivde predicted prices. Kaggle will then allow us to submit our prediction and give us a score on our prediction.


## Key Finding

### In this challenge we explored various ways to optimise our predictions.
### We first work on preprocessing the data to see which data can help us optimise our prediction.
### Then we tried various machine learning models to establish a baseline.
### Finally we tried our first Neural Network for our final submit.
